the man in the iron mask by alexandre dumas chapter i two old friends 
while every one at court was busy with his own affairs a man mysteriously 
took up his post behind the place de greve in the house which we once 
saw besieged by dartagnan on the occasion of a riot the principal entrance 
of this house was in the place baudoyer the house was tolerably large 

surrounded by gardens enclosed in the rue st jean by the shops of 
tool-makers which protected it from prying looks and was walled in
by a triple rampart of stone noise
